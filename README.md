You've been hired by Ed Sheeran to write the code for his new album cover. He's given you the specs for what he wants the album cover to look like. You can take a look at `MOCKUP.jpg` to see the specs.

You'll be coding your solution in `index.html`. Read the comments to help figure out what HTML tags to use. You'll use the text provided in `SOURCE.md` for the text of the album cover. Don't worry about the CSS. Other developers took care of that work for you.

The image you need (`hal-leonard-image.jpg`) is located in the images directory.

## The Task

**1.** Use an `h5` tag for the text in the top right corner

**2.** Use an `h1` tag for the album title

**3.** Use an `h2` tag for the record label credits

**4.** Use an `h3` tag for the music and lyrics credits

**5.** Use an `h6` tag for the Sony credits

**6.** Use an `img` tag for the Hal Leonard Corporation logo
